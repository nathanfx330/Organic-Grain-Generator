**Organic Grain Generator** is a desktop application for procedurally generating realistic, organic digital camera noise. It provides a highly interactive "workbench" for artists, developers, and technicians to model and craft specific noise patterns and export them as grain plates for compositing, texturing, and VFX workflows.

Unlike simple overlay noise tools, this generator simulates the distinct components of a digital camera sensor's noise profile, giving you fine-grained control over the final look.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé¨ VFX Pipeline Ready
- **Reproducible Noise Seed** ‚Äì Ensure patterns are 100% deterministic and repeatable.  
- **Frame Sequence Export** ‚Äì Export noise plates as numbered image sequences (e.g., `plate.1001.png`) with custom prefix, start frame, and end frame.  
- **Custom Resolution** ‚Äì Generate plates at any resolution (HD, 4K, 8K, etc.).

### üî¨ Advanced Noise Model
Individually control different types of noise for a highly realistic result:
- **Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN)** ‚Äì Sensor imperfections (PRNU gain & DSNU offset).  
- **Random Noise** ‚Äì Signal-dependent Shot (Poisson) noise and signal-independent Read (Gaussian) noise.  
- **Color Noise** ‚Äì Independent chrominance noise for rich, colorful grain.  
- **Firefly Noise** ‚Äì Simulates bright "hot pixels" seen in high ISO footage (e.g., Panasonic GH4).  
- **Banding Noise** ‚Äì Horizontal noise generated via Perlin noise.  
- **Quantization** ‚Äì Simulates bit-depth reduction, creating posterization and banding effects.

### ‚ö° Optimized for High Resolutions
- **Performance Controls** ‚Äì Disable "Real-time Preview" for 4K+ and update manually.  
- **Scalable Preview** ‚Äì Zoom options (`Fit to Window`, 100%, 50%, 25%).  
- **Live Detail View** ‚Äì Separate 500% zoom window for analyzing fine grain structure in real time.

## üí° Why Use This Tool?

Adding realistic camera noise is one of the most effective ways to integrate CG elements into live-action footage. It helps to:  
- Add realism to renders and composites.  
- Ensure consistent grain across multiple shots or artists.  
- Generate unique textures for procedural materials.  
- Study and replicate individual noise components for technical or artistic purposes.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.9+**

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy Pillow perlin-noise
````

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Set Core Parameters**

   * Enter Width, Height, and Noise Seed.
   * Click **Update Dimensions** to generate the base plate.

2. **Craft the Noise**

   * Adjust sliders to control individual noise components.
   * Preview updates automatically if enabled.

3. **Control the Preview**

   * Use the **Zoom dropdown** to resize the main view.
   * Disable **Real-time Preview** for large resolutions and refresh manually.
   * Open **Detail View** for a live 500% zoomed preview.

4. **Export**

   * **Single Image**: Save a single noise plate.
   * **Sequence**: Configure prefix, start, and end frames to export a numbered sequence.
