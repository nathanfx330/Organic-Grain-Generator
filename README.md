**Organic Grain Generator** is a desktop application for procedurally generating realistic, organic digital camera noise. It provides a highly interactive "workbench" for artists, developers, and technicians to model and craft specific noise patterns and export them as grain plates for compositing, texturing, and VFX workflows.

Instead of using a simple overlay, this tool simulates the distinct components of a digital camera sensor's noise profile, giving you fine-grained control over the final look.

## Key Features

### VFX Pipeline Ready
- **Reproducible Noise Seed**: Ensure noise patterns are deterministic and repeatable for consistent results.
- **Frame Sequence Export**: Export noise plates as numbered image sequences (`plate.1001.png`, `plate.1002.png`, etc.) with custom prefixes, start and end frames.
- **Custom Resolution**: Generate plates at HD, 4K, 8K, or any resolution.

### Advanced Noise Model
- **Component-Based Simulation**:
  - **Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN)**: Simulates PRNU gain and DSNU offset.
  - **Random Noise**: Shot (Poisson) + Read (Gaussian) noise.
  - **Color Noise**: Independent chrominance noise for rich grain.
  - **"Firefly" Noise**: Hot pixels (e.g., GH4 high ISO look) with density, intensity, and coloration controls.
  - **Banding Noise**: Horizontal pattern noise via Perlin noise.
  - **Quantization**: Simulates bit-depth reduction.

### Optimized for High Resolutions
- **Performance Controls**: Disable "Real-time Preview" to avoid lag at 4K+. Regenerate manually when needed.
- **Scalable Preview**: Zoom dropdown (`Fit to Window`, 100%, 50%, 25%).
- **Live Detail View**: 500% zoom window for pixel-level analysis.

## Why Use This Tool?

Adding realistic camera noise helps to:
- Integrate CG elements into live-action footage.
- Add realism and consistency across shots.
- Generate unique procedural textures.
- Study and replicate digital sensor noise components.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy Pillow perlin-noise
````

---

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Set Core Parameters**: Enter Width, Height, and Noise Seed. Click *Update Dimensions*.
2. **Craft the Noise**: Adjust sliders for different noise components.
3. **Control Preview**:

   * Use Zoom dropdown for scaling.
   * Disable *Real-time Preview* at high resolutions; refresh manually.
4. **Inspect Details**: Open *Show Detail View* for 500% zoom.
5. **Export Plates**:

   * Single shot: *Save Single Image*.
   * Sequence: Fill export fields â†’ *Export Sequence*.
